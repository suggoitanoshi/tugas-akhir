\section{Conclusion}
The merging of Efficient-Adam and CADA yields results which could reduce communication data size and communication rounds. In simpler models, The communication reduction does not happen because the parameter number is still small. But, for larger models, the communication rounds is reduced to 0.97 times that of CADA. The communication data size is also reduced to 0.29 times that of CADA. But, the communication data size is still larger than that of Efficient-Adam, since there are additional threshold values needed to be distributed to the workers.
